# Happy Moment

“A moment is a small particle of time. It is so small that one day is made of 6,400,099,980 moments. One snap equals sixty-five moments. If you start snapping your fingers now and continue snapping 98,463,977 times without stopping, the sun will rise and the sun will set, and the sky will grow dark and the night will deepen, and everyone will sleep while you are still snapping, until finally, sometime after daybreak, when you finish up your 98,463,077th snap, you will experience the truly intimate awareness of knowing exactly how you spent every single moment of a single day of your life.” 
 
 -A Tale for the Time Being, Ruth Ozeki
